* Definition
  
** introduction 

    For a long time work in facial recognition has being done and one of the key
    points of it is face alignment as it poses its own challenge.
    And the main tool used for the job is OpenCV which is used with DLIB to
    recognize Facial landmarks.

    The automatic recognition of landmarks is essential to be able to classify
    facial expressions, or face tracking, face animation, and even 3D face
    modeling.

    For example to classify facial expressions it is necessary to classify
    Facial Action Units also known as FACS cite:ekman1977facial, which in turn
    needs a proper face alignment.

    The problem of face alignment is among the most popular in the field of
    computer vision and today we have many different implementations to
    automatically recognize facial landmarks on images.
    The most known is the Active Appearance Model (AAM)
    cite:edwards1998face,matthews2004active.
 
    But today we also some good results using Deep learning to achieve the
    results for example the work done by Adrian Bulat on recognizing 3D facial
    landmarks cite:bulat2017far that shows remarkable results and is implemented
    in /Torch/ a framework for *LUA*. 
   
    As the DLIB model has difficulty on recognizing points on faces by the side
    view, this project focus on this problem and does its best to tackle this
    problem.
   
** Problem Statement  
   
    The problem in question take a image as input (the format and details will be
    discussed on the dataset section), and by using a regression model to
    calculate the position of the face landmarks on the given image.
    
    For that the models used to tackle this problem will output 152 numbers, where
    each number ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the X and Y of each of the 76
    landmarks. 
    
    The expected result is a model capable precisely recognize the set of
    landmarks.
    
   
** Metrics
   
   The results of this project was avaliated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
   this metrics was chosen as it is standard function for regression problems
   and it fits well problem in question. 
   
* Analysis   
  
** Dataset
   In this study the MUCT Face Database cite:Milborrow10 was used
   this dataset consists of pictures (resolution 480x640) taken from 276 subjects
   using 5 cameras in different angles and light conditions (total of 3755
   images) like the image below: 
  
   #+CAPTION: There is no images on the left but they can be reproduced by mirroring the right side
   [[./images/muct-views-lores.jpg]]
   
   Each picture is manually coded with 76 facial landmark like:
   [[./images/landmarks.jpg]]
 
 
   The landmarks are saved in to 4 different file formats

    - muct76.shape       shape file cite:milborrow2009active  
    - muct76.rda         R data file (www.r-project.org/
    - muct76.csv         comma separated values
    - muct76-opencv.csv  comma separated values in OpenCV coords (0,0 at top left).


    the coordinate system in these files is the one used by Stasm (i.e. the
    origin 0,0 is the center of the image, x increases as you move right, y
    increases as you move up).  The exception is muct76-opencv.csv, where the
    format is the "OpenCV format" (i.e. the origin 0,0 is at the top left, x
    increases as you move left, y increases as you move down). 

    Unavailable points are marked with coordinates 0,0 (regardless of the
    coordinate system mentioned above).  "Unavailable points" are points
    that are obscured by other facial features.  (This refers to landmarks
    behind the nose or side of the face -- the position of such landmarks
    cannot easily be estimated by human landmarkers -- in contrast, the
    position of landmarks behind hair or glasses was estimated by the
    landmarkers).  

    So any points with the coordinates 0,0 should be ignored.  Unavailable
    points appear only in camera views b and c.  

    the subjects 247 and 248 are identical twins.

    The data set is available via [[https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct][github]] or it is also a submodule on this
    project and by recursively initializing or cloning the data can be found in 
    folder project/dataset that is the recommended way as the scripts depend on
    this folder 
   # the data set was splited betwin a train and test 
    # When talking about the train and testing split I will split the data into
    # train 70% and test 30% but it cannot be a random split as we have many images
    # of a same subject.
    # So to be sure the test set is well done the split has to be node at a subject
    # level so the same person cannot be found on test and train.

    # The choice of this dataset is made because it has a reasonable size to train
    # on personal computers and moreover it has large room for data augmentation
    # if necessary
    # The focus on using this data set is that it provides data
    # to have a better result when the face is in the side view.


    # The dataset is public available via github on the following link
    # https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct

 
** Split the training and testing sets 
     
  As this dataset is composed by multiple images of the same subject the
  division of sets for training and testing could not be done at a random way
  as an special attention is needed to not have the same subject on the train
  and testing set.
    
  And after analyzing it was divided by taken the first 82 subjects for the
  testing set (249 images per camera total of 1245 around 30%)

  The function "decompress_dataset" on the /DataGen.py/ takes care of
  decompressing the data and splitting the training and testing set. 

** Data Analyses
     
   lets start by looking at one image from the database those images are on the
   format of 640x480. 
   [[./images/example1.png]]
   
   And lets plot the points on one image to have an insight: 
   
   [[./images/example2.png]]
   
   As is possible to see those images are large and have big regions with
   useless information like the background.
   
   To improve that lets use DLIB's face recognition to find the face area and
   crop it, for that we can use the function "crop\_image" from the /DataGen.py/ 
   this function takes the image and the size to crop we pass just one integer
   for the size as it crops the image in a square, and returns the cropped image
   and the bound box used to crop the image. 
   
   #+CAPTION: image cropped with the size of 299 x 299.  
   [[./images/example3.png]]
   
   But as the image have being cropped we also have to move the landmark points
   to match the new image, for that we can use the function "replace\_landmarks"
   which takes the bound box and the actual landmarks and return the new
   landmarks

   [[./images/example4.png]]
   
   the process of cropping the image brings 2 advantages to the project:
   - less resources needed to train model 
   - it makes possible to use images with more than one face in the future 

** Data Augmentation
     
   As explained before there is no cameras on the left but we can mirror the
   right images, starting from that we will implement a some data augmentation 
   like flipping every image horizontally and vertically.

   To achieve that we can use the function "flip\_image" also from /DataGen.py/
   it takes the image, the landmarks, the direction to flip, width and height.
   and returns the new image and landmarks.
   lets see the result:

   [[./images/example5.png]]
   
   By applying this to all images we finish with a total of 3723 testing images
   and 7497 training images  
   
** Algorithms and Techniques
  
   To tackle this problem 2 possibilities was taken in consideration:
   
   1. The use of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and map the points by
      returning the pixel of a landmarks
   2. The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a regression output
      returning the coordinates of the landmarks
      
   While the 2 approaches are valid this project focused on the second one as
   the first would require more experience and knowledge to do it.
   
   The project is composed of 2 parts:
   1. The CNN layer.
   2. The regression output.
  
   All the models have 1 thing in common the *output* all the models have a
   152 neurons dense layer using linear activation, used to predict the
   coordinate of the landmarks on the image.
   In the other hand the CNN part of every model is different, here the approach
   was to develop a CNN capable to pass a precise information about the shape in
   the image to the output layer so we could have a precise landmark on the
   image. 

   
** Benchmark 
   
   To bench mark this project a model using a CNN created from scratch was used 
   and the model and the results of this model can be seen at the [[CNN from
   scratch]] *CNN from scratch* in the [[Implementation]] *Implementation* section of
   this report.  
   

* Methodology   

** Data Preprocessing 
   
   Many steps of preprocessing have being taken and have being discussed on the
   [[Dataset]] section being then:
   - Split of the data discussed at the [[Split the training and testing sets]]
     *Split the training and testing sets* section
   - Image cropping detailed at the [[Data Analyses]] *Data Analyses* section
   - Data Augmentation described on the [[Data Augmentation]] *Data Augmentation* section
   - 
** Implementation
  
   For this project many different approaches have being taken and it will be
   presented here the best outcome of each "kind" of approaches like:
  
   - A CNN created from scratch
   - Inception transfer learning
   - ResNet50 transfer learning
  
   All the models have being trained in a cloud server for performance wise and
   saved to later study.
  
   The metrics used to observe the performance of every model was the mean square
   error (MSE)
  
   The models code can be found on the file /Models.py/.
  
   The models use a /"npz"/ file that can be generated via by using the function :
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
      DataGen.save_dataset(DataGen.create_dataset(size, True, True), "outputName")
   #+END_SRC
  
   And for the inception transfer learning it uses a bottleneck file that can be
   generated with the function:
  
   #+BEGIN_SRC python 
     DataGen.inception_bottleneck(<npz file>, "outputName")
   #+END_SRC
  
   every model was implemented using early stopping, TensorBoard and saves the
   best loss weights on a /hdf5/ file

*** CNN from scratch
   
    This CNN started with a model based on the AlexNet cite:krizhevsky2012imagenet 
    [[./images/alexnet6.jpg]]
    But we finished with a model as illustrated below:
    #+CAPTION: the full size image can be found on the report/images/mymodel.png.  
    [[./images/mymodel.png]]
   
    here is the learning curve from this model
    [[./images/mymodelLoss.png]]
   
    as we can see the learning curve for the training set was improving steadily
    but for the testing set it starts to get worst  around the epoch 16 and the
    early stopping is triggered at epoch 24 as it has no improvement.
   
    by taking the weights of the best loss and doing an inference on a set of
    training images we get the following result: 
   
    [[./images/mymodelTest.png]]
   
    It is noticible that the result is not satisfactory but it has plenty of room
    for improvement. but at this point of the project it started to get expensive
    to keep using the cloud machine to train and there was yet some other methods
    to try out.  
  
*** Inception transfer learning   

**** bottleneck
   
    The next step was to use transfer learning, by using the inceptionV3
    cite:szegedy2016rethinking, the first approach as to create bottleneck files
    from the inception and train a model with those outputs.
   
    As the previous model many models have being made and here is the best result 
    found by using this method was the following:
   
    #+CAPTION: the full size image can be found on the report/images/btn.png.  
    [[./images/btn.png]]
   
    In this model we took a different approach as just using the output of
    Inception wasn't given good results 3 different inputs was used the squared
    and the /sine/ of the inception output was also used in conjunction to the
    normal output 
   
   [[./images/btnLoss.png]] 
  
   The training of this model took 80 epochs before the early stopping was
   triggered while the learning curve on the test set is better them the previous
   model the loss is slightly bigger them the previous model:

   [[./images/btnResult.png]]
  
   And the results are far from good, worst then the previous model.

   #+END_EXPORT

  
**** Retrain 
    
     The next step here is to keep using the transfer learning from inception but
     give a bit of more room for improvement by training respectively the 2 last
     convolutional blocks of the inception and the 4 last ones:
    
    #+CAPTION: 4 block(red) 2 block(black).  
     [[./images/incep.png]]


   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT

***** *2 blocks results*

      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/incep249Loss.png}}
      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/incep249res.png}}

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT

***** *4 blocks results*

      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/incep197Loss.png}}
      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/incep197res.png}}
     

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT
      as we can see it really improved the results by using the 2 first blocks after a
      120 epochs we have a steady learning curve and we get a nice prediction on the
      testing images, but once we increase the number of training layers by using
      the first 4 block, the early stopping triggers 70 epochs before and while
      the results look good, however, it is worst then the model with 2 blocks.

    
*** ResNet50 transfer learning
    Here the same approach that as used with Inception is used with the ResNet50 cite:he2016deep  
    model, but as the ResNet50 uses images with format 224x224 and we have images
    with 299x299, while we could crop the images it is not a good solution as it
    was cutting out landmarks from some images. So the idea here is use the
    ResNet50 with different input. 
   
    2 models was trained here one that don't train any layer from ResNet50 and
    another that trains 2 convolutional blocks like:

    [[./images/resnet50.jpg]]

   
   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT
   
***** *0 blocks results*

      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/resnet0loss.png}}
      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/resnet0res.png}}


   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT
***** *2 blocks results*
     
      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/resnet2loss.png}}
      #+LaTeX: \centerline{\includegraphics[height=9cm]{./images/resnet2res.png}}

   #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \pagebreak
   #+END_EXPORT
     as it is noticible using just the output of ResNet50 did give better results
     them the inception but yet it wasn't satisfactory in the other hand when
     retraining 2 block it showed a really promising result
   
   
** Refinement
   while the results presented here are the best ones for each of the models 
   many trials have been done the first tuning was working with the learning
   and the optmizers and here is what was what was used:
**** SGD  
     all results were poor with this optimizer
     
**** RMSprop 
     that was the second optimizer tried it was a bit trick as the results were
     showing all the points accumulating near of the center of the image like:
     
     [[./images/RMSprop.png]]
     
     the approach to fix it was to increase the learning rate to 0.1 and use a
     learning rate decay until 0.0001 while that give better results, further
     analyses showed that wasn't the best approach

**** Adam
     this is the optimizer used on every model with exception of the benchmark
     model and while the reduction of a learning rate showed improvement on some
     other tests it was taking too long to train and exhausting the resources
     for this project and we sticked with the Keras default learning rate
     
**** Nadam 
     This optimizer as used for the benchmark model and showed good results (no
     tuning was made).


 
* Results
  
** Model evaluation and Validation
   After many trials the model that did best was the model based on the ResNet50
   retraining 2 blocks. this model not just had a good results as it takes a
   reasonable time to train. but the results steal not satisfactory as it does
   generalize enough on the test data it doesn't performs really well on data
   different from the on on the dataset.That is probably because all the images
   has the same background and this cam affect the outcome.
   At the end the model isn't a trustworthy model and some improvement has to be
   done. 
   


   
** Justification

  after all those tests and trials we can make a loss comparison for each model
  like:
  
  | model                | training loss | validation loss |
  |----------------------+---------------+-----------------|
  | scratch              |       0.01547 |         0.02588 |
  | inception bottleneck |       0.03599 |         0.03567 |
  | inception 2 blocks   |     0.0001108 |        0.003932 |
  | inception 4 blocks   |     0.0002229 |        0.003802 |
  | resnet50 0 blocks    |          0.01 |           0.013 |
  | resnet50 2 blocks    |    0.00005033 |        0.003779 |

  By doing this comparison we see that the ResNet50 model has the most
  promising results.
  Probably is possible to get even better results by training more layers or
  even making some adjustments.
  Another step is collect more datasets to combine with the MUCT dataset to
  improve the models generalization.
  But as this kind of training demands a lot of resources and keep the servers running started to get out of the budget the
  tests and development where halted at this point 
   
* Conclusion 
  
  This project throws in the spotlight a recurrent problem in the world of
  machine learning /the quality of the data/ this is the most important detail
  and the work done here shows how it impacts.
  As pointed before we have a model that is capable to return a fairly accurate
  landmarks on pictures that it haven't seen but if the picture has the same
  /context/ (i mean from the same dataset , the same background...) once it
  deviate from this the results are poor. and that is a problem that can be
  fixed by using some other datasets. as we can see for example in the project
  of  Adrian Bulat on recognizing 3D facial landmarks cite:bulat2017far it uses
  more than 5 different datasets to reach an acceptable result.
  
** Reflection
   
   Different that one outsider would think the challenge of this project is not
   to develop a machine learning but to understand the data you are working
   with, preparing the data to maximize the result.
   Mastering the data being used is more important them knowing the Machine
   learning / Deep learning structure you are going to use at the end this part
   is a lot of try and error. 
   The second challenge is process power power convolutional networks really
   bring the home PCs to its limits and oblige us to use cloud solutions. 
  

** Improvement 
  This project shows that the approach used is correct and that with more
  resources is possible to delivery a reliable face alignment. 
  The next step on such a project would be by starting by using some other
  datasets in conjunction to the MUCT so we can get a better generalization as
  all the images on this set has the same background it can bias the result. 
  
  And also by working on the hyper-parameters for the ResNet50 network and
  improving the results that would a start for getting a reliable face alignment
