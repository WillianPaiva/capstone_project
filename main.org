** Context
   
   For a long time work in facial recognition has being done and one of the key
   points of this work is the face alignment as it poses its own challenge.
   And the main tool used for the job is OpenCV which is used with DLIB to
   recognize Facial landmarks.
   
   The automatic recognition of landmarks is essential to be able to classify
   facial expressions, as it makes possible to classify Facial Action units also
   known as FACS cite:ekman1977facial, which in turn is used to recognize facial
   expression and sentiment analyses of such expressions.
   
   As one of my main projects today is to create a DNN capable to recognize
   facial expression of pain, this subject comes to be perfect as it cover a
   personal necessity and brings a good subject to work and learn.
   

** Existent Solutions

   Today we have many different implementations to automatically recognize
   facial landmarks on images. But yet find an implementations on Tensorflow is
   not that easy. As most of the works done on the subject is heavily dependent
   of DLIB to recognize the landmarks.
   
   Even the project [[https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet][Facenet]] cite:Charles2013 uses DLIB for this task. while some projects like
   the 3D facial landmarks cite:bulat2017far from Adrian Bulat provide
   remarkable results it is implemented in torch.
   
   So for that reason i propose for this project to create a Deep Neural Network to
   tackle such subject.

** The MUCT data base
   
   To work out this problem i propose to use the MUCT Face Database
   cite:Milborrow10  this dataset consists of pictures taken from 276 subjects
   using 5 cameras in different angles an light conditions like the image below: 
   #+CAPTION There is no images on the left but they cam be reproduced by mirroring the right side
   [[./images/muct-views-lores.jpg]]
   
   Each picture is coded with 76 facial landmark like: 
   [[./images/landmarks.jpg]]
   

   The dataset is public available via github on the following link
   https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct

** Solution and road map
   
   To solve such a problem i will begin from the point of training my own model 
   using Convolutional Neural Networks and compare the results by using transfer
   learning from other models inception v3 , resnet, etc.
   
   The main idea here is to create a model with 152 regression outputs giving
   the respective X and Y of each point.
   
   In case the transfer learning don't give good results another approach would
   be go up on the pre-trained model and get more fine tuning.
   By using the option:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   include_top=True
   #+END_SRC
   
   when importing the pre-trained model in Keras, and by freezing different parts
   of the model is possible to archive diferent results.
   
   

** Evaluation and Metrics     
   
   As the problem consists on a regression model i believe that for the
   evaluation of the results we could use the accuracy calculated by using one
   of the regression functions R-squared OR mean-squared.
